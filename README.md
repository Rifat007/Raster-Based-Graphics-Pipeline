# Raster-Based-Graphics-Pipeline
Raster Based Graphics Pipeline

In this assignment, the raster based graphics pipeline used in OpenGL is developed. The pipeline can be thought of as a series of four stages:

1. Stage 1: modeling transformation

2. Stage 2: view transformation

3. Stage 3: clipping and projection transformation

4. Stage 4: scan conversion using z-buffer algorithm

The program will take input from "scene.txt" file & output four files: stage1.txt, stage2.txt, stage3.txt and out.bmp. The first three files will contain the output of the first three stages, respectively. The fourth file will be a bmp image generated by the pipeline.
